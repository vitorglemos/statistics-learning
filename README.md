## Overview

### Inferential vs descriptive statistics
- **Descriptive statistics** summarize the characteristics of a data set. 
- **Inferential statistics** allow you to test a hypothesis or assess whether your data is generalizable to the broader population.

### About sample and population
- A **population** is the complete set of all the elements that are the object of the study (usually denoted with **N**).
- A **sample** is a part of the elements selected from the population according to well-defined rules (usually denoted with **n**). Samples are usually collected when it is impossible to collect data from a population (Example: election polls).

**Quantitative Variables**:
- **Discrete quantitative variable**: its possible values are results of a counting process. 
Examples: number of children, number of school grades attended with approval.

- **Continuous quantitative variable**: its possible values can be expressed from real numbers and sweep a continuous scale of measurement. 
Examples: monthly income, weight, height.

**Qualitative Variables**:
  - **Nominal qualitative variable**: its possible values are different unordered categories, where each observation can be classified. 
  Examples: race, nationality, area of activity.

- **Ordinal qualitative variable**: its possible values are different ordered categories, in which each observation can be classified. 
Examples: social class, level of education.
